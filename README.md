## :wrench: Process
I acquired the dataset in an Excel spreadsheet, connected and extracted it on Tableau. Ensured the data was clean and ready for visualization,
dragged-and-dropped fields into rows and columns shelves on the Worksheet. I applied dimensions (categorical data) and measures (quantitative data), 
chose appropriate chart types (bar, line, pie etc.) based on my analytical needs, while utilizing Filters for better interactivity. 
Finally, I combined the charts in a Dashboard for a comprehensive view.

## :bulb: Insights Uncovered

**Sales by Region:**

•	West leads significantly with a total sales of $107.48K and total profit of $19.66k for the four years in view. 
(It has also maintained this lead each year, except in 2016 where they made huge sales but very little profit).

•	Followed by East with total sales of $41.71K and total profit of $4.98k

•	South made total sales of $17.31K and total profit of $2.22k.

•	Central performed the least with total sales of $14.01K with no profit and a loss of $3.63k.

The West drives nearly 60% of company-wide sales. Other regions have potential, but need support.

**Sales by Category:**

•	Technology: $72.71K, Profit: $14.00K (Highest)

•	Furniture: $59.22K, Profit: $2.34K 

•	Office Supplies: $48.58K, Profit: $6.89K


Technology is the strongest contributor to profit and sales.
Furniture and Office Supplies, while generating decent revenue, have much lower profit margins, especially Furniture.

**Sales Over Time**

Overall Sales peaked in March ($22.22k), September ($29.48K) and December ($25.64K) with September accounting for the highest total sales. 

There was a significant drop in profit in 2016 ($2.61k) when compared with 2015 ($4.42k), despite having similar amount of sales. 

2017 recorded the best performance across all KPIs (sales, profit, quantity sold, orders and total customers).

Sales appears to be seasonal — optimize inventory and marketing around these peaks.
