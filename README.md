## :wrench: Process
I acquired the dataset in an Excel spreadsheet, connected and extracted it on Tableau. Ensured the data was clean and ready for visualization,
dragged-and-dropped fields into rows and columns shelves on the Worksheet. I applied dimensions (categorical data) and measures (quantitative data), 
chose appropriate chart types (bar, line, pie etc.) based on my analytical needs, while utilizing Filters for better interactivity. 
Finally, I combined the charts in a Dashboard for a comprehensive view.
