## :round_pushpin: Project Aims

:diamonds: To Explore and analyze Vertex-Hub's sales performance across regions, categories, and time.

:diamonds: Identify high-performing and underperforming products and segments.

:diamonds: Optimize the decision-making process with actionable insights.

:diamonds: Develop a Tableau dashboard for efficient data visualization and real-time decision support.

## :wrench: Process
I acquired the dataset in an Excel spreadsheet, connected and extracted it on Tableau. Ensured the data was clean and ready for visualization,
dragged-and-dropped fields into rows and columns shelves on the Worksheet. I applied dimensions (categorical data) and measures (quantitative data), 
chose appropriate chart types (bar, line, pie etc.) based on my analytical needs, while utilizing Filters for better interactivity. 
Finally, I combined the charts in a Dashboard for a comprehensive view.

## :bulb: Insights Uncovered

**Sales by Region:**

- West leads significantly with a total sales of $107.48K and total profit of $19.66k for the four years in view. 
(It has also maintained this lead each year, except in 2016 where they made huge sales but very little profit).

- Followed by East with total sales of $41.71K and total profit of $4.98k

- South made total sales of $17.31K and total profit of $2.22k.

- Central performed the least with total sales of $14.01K with no profit and a loss of $3.63k.

The West drives nearly 60% of company-wide sales. Other regions have potential, but need support.

**Sales by Category:**

- Technology: $72.71K, Profit: $14.00K (Highest)

- Furniture: $59.22K, Profit: $2.34K 

- Office Supplies: $48.58K, Profit: $6.89K


Technology is the strongest contributor to profit and sales.
Furniture and Office Supplies, while generating decent revenue, have much lower profit margins, especially Furniture.

**Sales Over Time**

- Overall Sales peaked in March ($22.22k), September ($29.48K) and December ($25.64K) with September accounting for the highest total sales. 

- There was a significant drop in profit in 2016 ($2.61k) when compared with 2015 ($4.42k), despite having similar amount of sales. 

- 2017 recorded the best performance across all KPIs (sales, profit, quantity sold, orders and total customers).

- Sales appears to be seasonal. Optimize inventory and marketing around these peaks.


**Customer Sales Table**

- Top customer by sales was Raymond Buch: $14,052.48 (Profit: $6,734.47).

- Luke Foster accounted for the poorest performance with sales of $2,656.72 and a loss of $3,791.16.

- Some low-sale customers are generating better margins than high-sale ones.

- It is also noteworthy that several customers generated losses despite moderate to high sales.

ðŸ”Ž **Observation:** The company is most likely overspending on fulfillment or offering heavy discounts that erode margins.

High quantity doesn't equal high profitabilityâ€”product pricing and cost control matter more.
